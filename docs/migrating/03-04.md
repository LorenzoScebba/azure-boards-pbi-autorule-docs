# Migrating from 0.3.0 to 0.4.0

---

**The variable names have been updated for easier understanding, please replace all variables using the following pattern:**

- `Rules__X__Rules__X__IfChildState` should be changed to `Rules__X__Rules__X__IfState`
- `Rules__X__Rules__X__AllChildren` should be changed to `Rules__X__Rules__X__All`

**A new rule type has been added that permits users to update a Work Item children based on the parent state.**

```json
{
  "Type": "Product Backlog Item", // When a PBI changes
  "Rules": [
    {
      "IfState": "Done", // If the PBI state is "Done"
      "SetChildrenStateTo": "Done" // Set all childrens (Tasks) to "Done" 
    }
  ]
}
```

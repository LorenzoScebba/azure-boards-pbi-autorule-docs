# Migrating from 0.4.0 to 0.5.0

---

**The variable names have been updated after the introduction of new rules, please rename the current variables appending a "State" at the beginning of the name:**

- `Rules__X__...` ->  `StateRules__X__...`

**The `/api/receive` endpoint for state change updates has been moved to `/api/state`**

**The new "AreaRules" have been added, giving the possibility to change the area of a work item type on creation**:

```json
{
  "AreaRules": [
    {
      "Type": ["Custom Task", "Custom Bug"], // When a custom task or a custom bug is created
      "Rule": {
        "SetAreaPathTo":"lorenzoscebba\\Area2" // Set its area path to lorenzoscebba\Area2
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
